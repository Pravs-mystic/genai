I tried training my custom model on a set
of images taken from Pexels, and I was surprised
by the outputs generated using that model.
I’ll provide the link to the images in the
description.
I used these pics after cropping them.
I found myself experiencing a spectrum of
emotions, ranging from a sense of hopelessness
to sheer astonishment while generating images
from my model.
In order to train your own custom model, go
to the training and data sets option in the
side panel and click on new data set, give
it a name and description, then click on create
data set.
Now upload your images from your computer
and then click on train model.
Enter the name, description, and instance
prompt, and click on start training.
The instance prompt is the phrase you will
use in your image prompt to generate images
from your model.
Now let’s generate some images from our
model!
Go to image generation and click on select
other models in the finetuned models, then
go to your models and click on settings.
Select characters as the category and click
on save.
Now select view and click on generate using
this model.
Let’s give a simple prompt first.
"Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red
t-shirt"
Click on generate…
Wow, the image looks exactly like the person
from our training set.
Of course, the face is not refined.
Let’s use Alchemy up Scaler in low and high
resolutions…
Wow, it looks great.
Let’s give another simple prompt.
"Andrea, smiling."
This time let’s add an element.
I’ll select ivory and gold…
Oh my God!
This is so cool!
Now I’ll try giving something different.
"Andrea, 2-year-old."
And select preset as none.
Okay, the image is not good.
Let’s refine it…
Wow, I think Andrea would look like this when
she was a two-year-old child…
Next prompt.
"Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet."
With Preset none…
Amazing!
Look at her face.
Since I mentioned the word woman, the face
is now more matured…
Next!
"Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie
gown" and set preset as general…
Yeah, it’s good but the image needs refining.
"Andrea as Snow White."
Okay, this looks like Snow White, but the
face is not anything similar to Andrea.
"Andrea, as the mythological character Sita
from Ramayana."
This is not Sita!
But you know what?
The model added some Indian touch to the girl.
She even has vermilion on her face!
"Andrea, as a fairy with wings."
Okay, when I said fairy with wings, the model
interpreted it as a child.
"Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress."
The image looks good, but she is not Andrea!
"Andrea, in the style of Wonder Woman.”—
Wonderful!
This is so good!

Okay!
All in all, I would say, training my own model
and trying all these random prompts was worth
it, though I lost so many tokens from doing
a ton of trial and error.
