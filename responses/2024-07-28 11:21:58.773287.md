# Answer

Based on the transcript provided by the tool, here are the key points from the video:

- The user trained a custom AI model using images from Pexels and was surprised by the range of emotions and outputs the model generated.

- The user walks through the steps to train a custom model in the tool, including creating a new dataset, uploading images, setting the instance prompt, and starting the training.

- The user then generates several images using different prompts with the trained model, including "Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red t-shirt", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", "Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie gown", "Andrea as Snow White", "Andrea as the mythological character Sita from Ramayana", "Andrea as a fairy with wings", and "Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress".

- The user comments on the quality and accuracy of the generated images, noting both successes and areas where the model did not perform as expected.

- Overall, the user found the process of training and testing the custom model to be worthwhile, though they used up a lot of their token allowance in the trial and error process.
