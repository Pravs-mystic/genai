# Answer

Based on the video summary provided by the tool, here are the key points:

- The user trained a custom AI model on a set of images from Pexels and was surprised by the range of emotions and outputs generated.

- To train your own custom model, the user explains the steps - creating a new dataset, uploading images, and starting the training process. They mention setting an "instance prompt" which is the phrase used to generate images from the model.

- The user then tries out various prompts to generate images of a character named "Andrea" in different styles and settings, such as portraits, a 2-year-old version, Andrea on the red carpet, as Snow White, a fairy with wings, and in the style of Wonder Woman.

- The results are mixed, with some prompts generating good results that capture the essence of the prompt, while others produce images that don't quite match the intended look.

- Overall, the user found the process of training and experimenting with their custom model to be worthwhile, though they mention losing a lot of "tokens" (likely credits) through trial and error.
