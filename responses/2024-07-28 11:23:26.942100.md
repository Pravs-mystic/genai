# Answer

Here is a summary of the key points from the video:

- The video creator trained a custom AI model on a set of images from Pexels and was surprised by the results when generating new images using the model.

- The process for training a custom model involves creating a new dataset, uploading the images, setting the instance prompt, and starting the training.

- The video shows the creator generating various prompts and images using the custom model, such as portraits of "Andrea" in different styles and as different characters.

- The results were a mix of successes and failures, with some images looking very realistic and accurate, while others missed the mark. The creator experienced a range of emotions from hopelessness to astonishment.

- Overall, the video highlights the capabilities and limitations of training a custom AI image generation model, and the importance of experimentation and refinement to get good results.
