# Answer

Okay, let me try to answer the question based on the context provided in the YouTube transcript.

The answer is right. The transcript indicates that the person trained their own custom model on a set of images from Pexels, and then proceeded to generate various images using different prompts. They experimented with different prompts like "Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red t-shirt", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", and more. The transcript suggests that the person was generally pleased with the results, though some prompts produced less desirable outputs.
