The video discusses the use of basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease. Key points from the transcript include:

- The basal ganglia are a group of structures deep within the brain that are involved in movement control and other important functions.
- In Parkinson's disease, certain neurons in the basal ganglia that produce dopamine start to die off, leading to impaired movement and other symptoms.
- Identifying the specific mechanisms by which the basal ganglia are affected in Parkinson's is an active area of research that could lead to better treatments.
- Understanding the basal ganglia's role in Parkinson's involves studying the complex interplay of different neurotransmitters and brain regions.
- Continued research on the basal ganglia and Parkinson's pathology may uncover new therapeutic targets and approaches.
