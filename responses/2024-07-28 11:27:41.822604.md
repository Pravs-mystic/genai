# Answer

Here is a summary of the key points from the video:

- The user trained a custom AI model on a set of images from Pexels and tried generating images using different prompts. 

- The generated images showed a range of emotions, from disappointment to amazement, as the model tried to interpret the prompts.

- The video walks through the process of creating a custom data set, training the model, and then generating images using various prompts like "Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red t-shirt", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", "Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie gown", "Andrea as Snow White", "Andrea, as the mythological character Sita from Ramayana", "Andrea, as a fairy with wings", and "Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress".

- The quality and accuracy of the generated images varied, with some looking very realistic while others had issues with the face or overall appearance.

- Overall, the user found the process of training a custom model and experimenting with different prompts to be worth it, though it consumed a lot of tokens from trial and error.
