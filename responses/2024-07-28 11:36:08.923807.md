# Answer

Based on the video transcript provided by the tool, here are the key points:

- The user trained a custom image generation model on a set of images from Pexels and experimented with different prompts to generate images.

- The user walked through the process of creating a custom data set, training the model, and then generating images using various prompts.

- The generated images showed varying degrees of quality and accuracy, with some capturing the intended subject well, while others had issues with the face or other elements.

- The user tried prompts like "Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red t-shirt", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", "Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie gown", "Andrea as Snow White", "Andrea, as the mythological character Sita from Ramayana", "Andrea, as a fairy with wings", and "Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress".

- Overall, the user found the experiment of training a custom model and trying different prompts to be worthwhile, though it consumed a lot of tokens during the trial and error process.
