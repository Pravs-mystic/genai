# Answer

Based on the video transcript provided by the tool, here are the key points:

- The user tried training a custom AI model on a set of images from Pexels and was surprised by the outputs generated using that model.
- The user walks through the steps to create a custom dataset, train a model, and then generate images using various prompts.
- The user tries out different prompts like "Andrea, portrait of a girl", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", "Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie gown", "Andrea as Snow White", "Andrea, as the mythological character Sita from Ramayana", "Andrea, as a fairy with wings", "Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress", and "Andrea, in the style of Wonder Woman".
- The user notes that the model interpreted the prompts in interesting and sometimes unexpected ways, leading to a range of generated images.
- Overall, the user found the process of training the custom model and trying out different prompts to be worthwhile, despite losing some tokens through trial and error.
