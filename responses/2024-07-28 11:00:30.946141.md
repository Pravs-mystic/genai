# Answer

Based on the video transcript provided by the tool, here are the key points:

- The user trained a custom AI model on a set of images from Pexels and was surprised by the outputs generated using that model.
- To train your own custom model, the user explains the steps - creating a new dataset, uploading images, entering training details, and starting the training process.
- The user then tries out various prompts to generate images using the custom trained model, such as "Andrea, portrait of a girl wearing a red t-shirt", "Andrea, smiling", "Andrea, 2-year-old", "Andrea, portrait of a woman on the red carpet", "Andrea, portrait of a woman wearing a Barbie gown", "Andrea as Snow White", "Andrea, as the mythological character Sita from Ramayana", "Andrea, as a fairy with wings", "Andrea wearing a long red bridal dress", and "Andrea, in the style of Wonder Woman".
- The user comments on the quality and accuracy of the generated images, ranging from impressed to disappointed.
- Overall, the user found the experience of training and experimenting with the custom model to be worthwhile, despite using up a lot of "tokens" through trial and error.
